## üíª Featured Projects
| Project | Description | Link |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Predictive Maintenance Simulator** | Simulated sensor data + Isolation Forest anomaly detection | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rajkumar160798/predictive-maintenance-and-smart-automation) |
|**prophet-failure-forecast**| utilized Facebook Prophet to predict when equipment might fail ‚Äî even before anomalies start showing up | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rajkumar160798/prophet-failure-forecast) |
|**smart-forecast-deployment-api**|A FastAPI-based microservice that forecasts future temperature sensor readings using a trained Prophet model and flags potential failure risks based on a critical threshold.|[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rajkumar160798/smart-forecast-deployment-api) |
|**AI-Based Predictive Maintenance for Industrial IoT**|This project simulates sensor data from industrial equipment and uses a combination of rule-based logic and AI models (e.g., Facebook Prophet) to detect early signs of failure. |[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rajkumar160798/ai-predictive-maintenance)|
| More coming soon... | Stay tuned for time-series models, MLOps pipelines, and more |
